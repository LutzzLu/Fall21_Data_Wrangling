# data wrangling Genetics

## Describtion
In this project, we have the types of tumors as labels and gene data with the name of each RNA sequence. The main porpose is to predict labels for new genes by applying the model we built with existing dataset. 

There are four parts in total, the first part is to reduce dimension of data in three methods separately, the methods are principle component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP).
