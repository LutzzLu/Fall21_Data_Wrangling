# data_wrangling Genetics

## This is the introduction part.

In the dimension_reduce Rmd, I basicly transform the code from Python to R. I use three method to do the dimension reducing work, and do a little bit data visualization work to see if the dimension is successfully reduced and how it performs.

In the data_viz Rmd, I try several methods to finish the basic data viz. 

And for the DBC Dashboard.Rmd, it's a code example from Mina. Shout out to Mina! I use this as an example to develop a simple interactive data viz dashboard using my dataset.

In the Random_Forest.Rmd, I use three different method dimension reduced datasets to train random forest model.

And the interactive_viz.Rmd is the data viz dashboard of mine.
